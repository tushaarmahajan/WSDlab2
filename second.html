            A portion is the amount of food you put on your plate, while a serving is an exact amount of food Serving sizes have ballooned recently. By serving your meals on smaller plates or in bowls, you can trick your brain into thinking it's a larger portion. If you don't feel satisfied at the end of a meal, add more leafy greens.

            Add More Fruit And Vegetables To Your Diet
            Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the amount we currently eat.
            
            To increase your intake:
            Add antioxidant-rich berries to your favorite breakfast cereal
            Eat a medley of sweet fruit—oranges, mangos, pineapple,
            grapes—for dessert
            Swap your usual rice or pasta side dish for a colorful salad
            Instead of eating processed snack foods, snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry tomatoes along with a spicy hummus dip or peanut butter. While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.
